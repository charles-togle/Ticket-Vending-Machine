### Ticket Vending Machine
- This **Ticket Vending Machine** is specifically designed and programmed to work like the ticket vending machine in MRT-3
## Why This
- The creator of this project currently studies at the university of makati in which he rides the MRT 3-4 times a week, he has to load his beep card through this ticket vending machines. Sparked by his curiosity, he decided to build a copy of the said ticket vending machine
- This will also serve as a refresher for future projects that will be coded in ReactJS + TailwindCSS
## Gaps
- Logic in paying is inputted unlike the real ticket vending machine which you need to insert the money
- Logic in finding card is through searching the card number and unlike in the real ticket vending machine you have to put your card in the sensor
## What have I learned in this project
- I have learnt to use backend specifically in displaying and retrieving data as used in the Stored Value Card or Beep Card
- Learnt how to use TailwindCSS - this is the first time the programmer used TailwindCSS in a project
- Learnt how to use Typescript - this is also the first time that the programmer used Typescript in his ReactJS project
## What would I like to learn in the future
- Better use of Typescript
- useRef hook
- memorize the format and the process of using context and providers, and create hooks for them
